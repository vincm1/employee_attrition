# Employee Attrition Analysis - IBM Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. The goal is to identify key factors that lead to employee turnover and develop strategies to improve employee retention. This analysis is performed using Python and the project is hosted on Kaggle, leveraging its interactive environment and rich dataset library.

The Kaggle Notebook can be found under:

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which contains various details about IBM employees, such as age, job role, marital status, and monthly income. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

Employee demographics (age, gender, education, etc.)
Work-related characteristics (job role, job level, job satisfaction, etc.)
Employee turnover information (attrition)

## Analysis Overview

The analysis consists of the following steps:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, relationships between variables.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features that can help in the analysis.
- Model Building: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict employee attrition.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Insights & Recommendations: Drawing conclusions and providing business recommendations based on the analysis.

## Results
Key findings and insights from the analysis are summarized in the notebook. A detailed report of the findings and recommendations for reducing employee attrition is also provided.
